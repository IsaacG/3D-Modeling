Collection of 3D Modeling projects

container_bottom:
* A bottom tray to put in tupperware containers so I can put cut up fruit in the container and have the fruit not sit in liquids
* Going to 3D print a hex and non-hex version (there's a flag buried in that mess) and see how they perform.

coaster.scad:
* A coaster with an E emblem. Either use as a coaster or I can add more of the bottom on to make it more like a half-dome button - less functional, more pretty.
* I'm thinking of doing this one on the CNC mill with either wood or acrylic. Might 3D print as a prototype.
